# CapstoneSTAHull

This repository is for the STA Development Team in Mrs. Hull's room for working on the capstone project. 

The master branch will *always* have production-ready code. You may only make a pull-request with this branch if your code is bug-free, up to standard, and well-tested. Any code that is well-commented and fully built, but not tested and bug-free may be pushed to the vNext branch
