# How to use GitHub

This will not tell you how to use all of github, just what you need to know. When you are finished for the day, you will do this.

* Open up github (the program not shell)
* Make sure you have the right repository selected (CapstoneSTAHull)
* Make sure you have the right branch selected (Should be yourname-work where yourname is your name)
* Click the cog-wheel in the top right and click "Open in Git-Shell"
* Once the shell opens you will see your branch name in a fancy color. If the branch is blue, then everything is good! If it is green then you need to do the command "git push". If your name has some red numbers after it, then you need to add a file to the git tracker by using "git add <file path as shown in console>". If your name has some green numbers after it, you need to commit, so use the command "git commit -a". Once you commit, you'll see a file popup in notepad. What you need to do here is write what changes you made and why. Once you write that, go ahead and save and close the window, and then do "git push"
* Thats it! You should do this on a semi-regular basis. Doesn't actually matter how often, just make sure you do it
* ONLY COMMIT TO YOUR BRANCH! When you have a working version of whatever needs to be done on your branch, then we can make a pull request to the vNext branch, and once its cleared there, we can pull with master
