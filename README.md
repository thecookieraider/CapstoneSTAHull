# How to use GitHub

This will not tell you how to use all of github, just what you need to know. When you are finished for the day, you will do this.

* Open up github (the program not shell)
[Read more words!](Pics/gitshellbluetext.png)
* Make sure you have the right repository selected (CapstoneSTAHull)
* Make sure you have the right branch selected (Should be yourname-work where yourname is your name)
* Click the cog-wheel in the top right and click "Open in Git-Shell"
* Once the shell opens you will see your branch name in a fancy color (if it is not your branch name you need to exit and make sure you are on your own branch in the github program). If the branch is blue, then everything is good! If it is green then you need to do the command "git push". If your name has some red numbers after it, then you need to do "git add --all". If your name has some green numbers after it, you need to commit, so use the command "git commit -a". Once you commit, you'll see a file popup in notepad. What you need to do here is write what changes you made and why. Once you write that, go ahead and save and close the window, and then do "git push". IF YOU HAVE HAD YOUR CONSOLE WINDOW OPEN FOR A WHILE, THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS USE "git status" SO YOUR COLORS UPDATE
* If your shell is red, then that means you need to use "git pull"
* Now, lets say for example that Johnny wants to pull in all of Danny's work onto his computer. To do that you would go to the github program, go to Danny's branch, go into git shell, and do "git pull" and you would pull in his entire branch!
* Thats it! You should do this on a semi-regular basis. Doesn't actually matter how often, just make sure you do it
* ONLY COMMIT TO YOUR BRANCH! When you have a working version of whatever needs to be done on your branch, then we can make a pull request to the vNext branch, and once its cleared there, we can pull with master
